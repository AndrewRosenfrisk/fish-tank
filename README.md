# Fish Tank

## About

Watch your own virtual fish in a virtual fish tank, complete with air bubblers and kelp plants. 
Each time you run the program, it randomly generates the fish using different fish types and colors. 
Take a break and enjoy the calm serenity of this software aquarium, or try programming in some virtual 
sharks to terrorize its inhabitants!
